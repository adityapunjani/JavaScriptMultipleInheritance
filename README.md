Multiple Inheritance Implemented in JavaScript
=============================

What is multiple inheritance? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance

What does it mean in JavaScript? :
Having 3 classes (constructor functions) "Name" , "Age" and "Place" , create an object "person" which should inherit from all three constructors. It should have all the prototype properties of each constructor and 'own' properties of each constructor. Also "person" should be an instance of all 3. Thus dynamically adding prototypes properties to any constructor should reflect for "person" as well.
Extra test case: Any objects of "Name" , "Age" , "Place" should NOT be instances of each other.
